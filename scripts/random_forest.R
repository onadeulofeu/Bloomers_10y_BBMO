## we need to create a wide dataset with environmental variables and each ASV that we consider it is a potential bloomer
## do we need to normalize environmental variables to z-scores?
## Is there a way to add the community effect on a blooming event in this test? add bray curtis as an env variable?
## Could we add eukaryotes data here?


## Caret package https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html

## prepare the dataset----




### I pick representatives of different clusters and see how it goes

##EXAMPLES FOR EACH TYPE OF BLOOM 
### 'asv17', 'asv23', 'asv11', 'asv84', 'asv62', 'asv58', 'asv555', 'asv558')

## ideas data that I should add here: diatoms, ciliates, dinophlgellates, 

## do we add diversity in the random forest?
