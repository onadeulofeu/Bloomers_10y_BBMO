## we need to create a wide dataset with environmental variables and each ASV that we consider it is a potential bloomer
## do we need to normalize environmental variables to z-scores?
## Is there a way to add the community effect on a blooming event in this test? add bray curtis as an env variable?
## Could we add eukaryotes data here?


## Caret package https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html

## prepare the dataset----




### I pick representatives of different clusters and see how it goes

### asv11 (Glaciecola)
## asv62


## ideas data that I should add here: diatoms, ciliates, dinophlgellates, 

## do we add diversity in the random forest?
